# KSH SmartOps – Interactive Warehouse Dashboard

## Overview
During my internship at KSH Group, warehouse operational data such as overtime (OT), complaints, approvals, and customer-wise activity was being tracked using Excel-based dashboards. While functional, these reports were manual, static, and difficult to scale or analyze efficiently.  

This project focuses on converting those Excel reports into an **interactive dashboard** that provides clear visibility into warehouse operations and supports faster, data-driven decision-making.

## Problem at KSH
- Operational data was maintained in **multiple Excel files**
- Reports were **static** and required manual effort to update
- Limited ability to **filter, drill down, or analyze trends**
- Difficult to generate **consistent managerial reports**
- Not suitable for scaling across multiple warehouses

---

## Why Excel Was Not Enough
Excel worked for basic reporting but had limitations:
- No interactive filtering or dynamic visualizations
- High dependency on individuals to maintain reports
- Time-consuming report preparation
- Not designed for real-time insights or automation
- Limited scope for future system integration

---

## What I Built
I developed a **web-based interactive dashboard** that allows warehouse data to be uploaded from Excel and instantly converted into meaningful insights.

The dashboard includes:
- Excel file upload with validation
- Warehouse-wise, customer-wise, and contractor-wise filtering
- Overtime hours and cost analysis
- Complaint and approval trend visualization
- Interactive charts for operational insights
- One-click export of filtered data and PDF manager reports

This solution was built as a **Proof of Concept (PoC)** aligned with real warehouse requirements discussed during the internship.
